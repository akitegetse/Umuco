<!--The span tag in this table cell is added for Localization purposes. Some languages use a different symbol for menu paths, but Trados does not allow the cell to be translated unless some text is present in the cell. The word conventions was chosen to match the title of the topic, to avoid strangeness in a full-text search. Do not remove this tag.-->
